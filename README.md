# MOOGLE ‚ú®

## A Search Engine Project üîç

This project is a classic in Matcom's first programming projects. Let's take a look at it! 

If you'd like, you can read the full project orientation (in Spanish) clicking [here](https://github.com/matcom/moogle) .

## Let's dive into the repo! üíª

This project utilizes CSS for the visual component. You'll find a search bar where you can input your desired search term. 

The search functionality employs TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find your word in all the `.txt` files within the project.

## LaTeX Report üìö

To access the LaTeX report, which provides a more detailed description of the code (sorry if it's not made with elegance, it was my first LaTeX code!), you'll need to build the PDF by running `proyect.sh` in the "Script" folder.

## Script Commands

The only available commands in the bash file are: 

- `run`: To run the project.
- `clean`: To clean the report and slides LaTeX build files.
- `report`: To build the LaTeX report.
- `slide`: To build the LaTeX slides.
- `show_report`: To show the LaTeX report.
- `show_slide`: To show the LaTeX slides.
